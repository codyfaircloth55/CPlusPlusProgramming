# CPlusPlusProgramming

#Summary:
This code is designed to create an integrated application using both C++ and python. This program is designed to read a file that contains a list of words and then performs 3 functions. The first function is counting the number of instances of each word in the input file. This information is then output to the user. The second function is counting the number of instance of a word given by user input in the file being read. The final function is to count the number of instances of each word in the input file then outputting that data to another file then using the data from the output file to create a histogram of the number of instances of each word as output to the user.

#Strengths:
I believe I made this code readible and encapsulated well. Most of the code takes place outside of main(). One goal of this project was to include as little code in main() as possible and I believe I achieved that goal.

#Improvement:
This code could be improved on by adding more functions to do further data analysis in the Python code. This code could also be improved to allow the user to input file names to be analyzed which would increase the programs functionality.

#Challenges:
Reading files for input and processing the data to then output as a separate file was the most challenging. Doing this part in Python which has more simplistic syntax allieviated some of the challenge. Any problems with syntax were solved through various coding websites that explained the proper syntax for each situation.

#Transferrable Skills:
The skill of integrating languages into a single program and using the strengths of each language to make a more efficient program will be useful for future projects and course work.

#Industry Standards:
I made this code readable, maintainable, and adaptable by using industry best practices. I used proper naming conventions for variables and function for each language. I included inline comments to explain what each piece of code does.
